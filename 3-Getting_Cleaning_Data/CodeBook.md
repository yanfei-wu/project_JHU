##Identifier

Subjects: Factor w/ 30 levels "1","2","3","4",..;identifier of the 30 subjects who participated in the experiments

Activities: Factor w/ 6 levels "walking","walking_upstairs","walking_downstairs","sitting","standing","laying"; links measurements with activity names

##Cleaning Procedures
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Measurements and Variables

The raw data set contains a 561-feature vector coming from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals TimeAcceleration-XYZ and TimeGyroscope-XYZ.

These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (TimeBodyAcceleration-XYZ and TimeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (TimeBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ and TimeBodyGyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these 3D signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (TimeBodyAccelerationMag, TimeGravityAccelerationMag, TimeBodyAccelerationJerkMag, TimeBodyGyroscopeMag, TimeBodyGyroscopeJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing FrequencyBodyAcceleration-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, FrequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, FrequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMag, FrequencyBodyGyroscopeMag, FrequencyBodyGyroscopeJerkMag. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

66 measurements were selected from the 561 features from the raw dataset by run_analysis.R. The new tidy dataset (tidydata.txt) created by run_analysis.R contains mean of each selected measurement for each activity and each subject. 

These selected measurements are listed as follow:
