# Building Regression Models  

This project analyzes the `mtcars` dataset in R by performing some exploratory data analyses and building regression models. The relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) is investigated. 

It is found that MPG is mainly related to vehicle weight and number of cylinders. Manual transmission is better than auto transmission on MPG. But with the given dataset, we are unable to correctly quantify the difference between the two types of transmissions on MPG.
