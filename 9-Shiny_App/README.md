# Shiny Application of California Home Value  

This project is to build a shiny application that reactively displays the trend of home values in CA. The home values displayed are based on Zillow Home Value Index. The data was download from http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/State/State_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv

In addition to the `ui.R` and `server.R` files, a pitch slide deck made by R `Slidify` package is also included.
