# Projects for Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization

This repo contains a list of projects for my studies of Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera. **All projects were done in `R`**. These projects include: 

## R Plotting (`1-ExData_Plotting/`) 

- Explored the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- Used the base plotting system to construct plots to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007 

--- 

## Cache Function in R (`2-Cache`) 

- Wrote R function that is able to cache potentially time-consuming computations including calculating the mean of a vector, and inverse an matrix 

---  

## Getting and Cleaning Data (`3-Getting_Cleanning_Data`) 

- Wrote an R script that gets data, cleans up data, and generates a seperate tidy dataset for later analysis 
- Created a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

## Analyzing Activity Dataset (`4-Activity_Data_Analysis`)  

- Loaded and processed an activity dataset 
- Used histograms and time series plots to visualize the patterns and trends in data 
- Created factor variables to analyze and compare patterns of interest  

--- 

## Analyzing NOAA Stom Dataset (`5-NOAA_Stom_Data_Analysis`) 

- Explored the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database and analyzed the major storms and weather events occured from 1950 to November 2011 in the United States. 
- Cleaned up the dataset by filtering the records, converting the units of measurements, and re-assigning values to a categorical variable through clustering algorithm 
- Analyzed and identified types of events that are most harmful to the population health and have the greatest economic consequences

## Building Regression Models (`6-Regression`)
- Performed exploratory analysis on the `mtcars` dataset 
- Built and compared multivariate regression models 

---  

## Statistical Inference (`7-Statistical_Inference`) 

- Investigated the exponential distribution in R and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem 
- analyzed the `ToothGrowth` dataset in the R `datasets` package; Performed basic exploratory data analyses and used confidence intervals and hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by `supp` and `dose`.  

--- 

## Machine Learning with Human Activity Data (`8-Machine_Learning`)

- Explored human activity data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants 
- Built Random Forest classification model to predict the manner in which people did the exercise  

---  

## Shinny App (`9-Shinny_App`)

- Built a Shiny app to reactively display the trend of home values in CA  
- Made a slide deck with R `Slidify` package to introduce the app
