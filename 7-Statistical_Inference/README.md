# Statistical Inference 

This project contains two subprojects as listed below: 

1. Simulation of Exponential Distribution  

This subproject investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem. Specifically, the sample mean and the sample variance are shown by simulations and are compared to the theoretical values of the distribution. Also, the distribution is shown to be approximately normal.  

2. Analysis of ToothGrowth Dataset 

This subproject analyzes the `ToothGrowth` dataset in the R `datasets` package. Some basic exploratory data analyses are performed and a basic summary of the data is given. Also, confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are used to compare tooth growth by `supp` and `dose`.
